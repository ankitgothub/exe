# Program to Calculate e^x by Recursion


# Recursive Function
# global variables p and f
p = 1.0
f = 1.0

	global p, f

	# Termination condition
	if (n == 0):
		return 1

	# Recursive call
	r = e(x, n - 1)

	# Update the power of x
	p = p * x

	# Factorial
	f = f * n

Efficient program to calculate e^x

# Python program to calculate
# e raise to the power x

# Function to calculate value
# using sum of first n terms of
# Taylor Series
def exponential(n, x):

	# initialize sum of series
	sum = 1.0
	for i in range(n, 0, -1):
		sum = 1 + x * sum / i
	print ("e^x =", sum)

# Driver program to test above function
n = 10
x = 1.0
exponential(n, x)
